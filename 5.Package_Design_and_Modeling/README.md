# The complete process flow of semiconductor package assembly, starting from when the wafer exits the fabrication (fab) to the molding/sealing stage, creating a virtual model of the package cross-section.1. Wafer Exits Fab

The fabricated wafer, containing multiple integrated circuits (dies), leaves the semiconductor fab after front-end processing (transistor formation, metallization, etc.).

⚙️ 2. Probe Testing

Each die on the wafer is electrically tested using probe cards to identify good and bad dies (known as KGD — Known Good Dies).
✔ Good dies → move forward for packaging
✖ Defective dies → marked or discarded

🧼 3. Die Inking

A tiny ink dot is placed on defective dies to mark them as bad during probe testing. This ensures only good dies are used in later steps.

💧 4. Wafer Thinning and Cleaning

To meet the required package height, wafers are mechanically ground and polished from the backside to reduce thickness.
This step improves thermal performance and reduces overall device thickness (especially important in mobile devices).

🔥 5. Wafer Bake

The wafer is baked to remove moisture and contaminants before dicing, improving adhesion and preventing cracks.

✂️ 6. Wafer Dicing

The wafer is cut into individual dies using a diamond saw blade or laser.
Each die is now a separate chip ready for assembly.

🤖 7. Pick and Place

Automatic robotic arms pick up individual dies from the diced wafer and precisely place them onto package substrates or leadframes.

🧲 8. Die Attach / Eutectic Reflow

The die is attached to the substrate or leadframe using an adhesive epoxy or eutectic solder (gold-tin, silver, or lead-based).
This ensures thermal and electrical contact between the die and the base.

🪡 9. Wire Bonding

Fine gold or aluminum wires are bonded between the die bond pads and the package leads or substrate pads, forming the electrical interconnections.

🧴 10. Sealing (Molding / Lid Attach)

The die and bond wires are encapsulated using an epoxy molding compound (plastic packaging) or sealed with a ceramic lid (in ceramic packages).
This protects the circuit from mechanical stress, dust, and moisture.

🔩 11. Solder Dip / Lead Trimming & Forming

The package leads are coated (solder dipped) for improved solderability, then trimmed and bent into the desired lead shape (e.g., gull-wing for QFP, J-lead for PLCC).

🏷️ 12. Part Marking

Laser or ink markings are added for part identification — including model number, batch, and manufacturer information.

🧪 13. Electrical Testing

Final electrical tests are conducted to verify performance, timing, and functionality.
Any non-functional units are rejected.

✅ 14. Final Output

The completed and sealed IC package (with metal pins, encapsulation, and lid seal) is now ready for shipment or integration into PCBs.

💡 In Summary

This process converts a fragile silicon wafer into a fully encapsulated, testable integrated circuit package, capable of surviving mechanical handling, soldering, and long-term operation.
