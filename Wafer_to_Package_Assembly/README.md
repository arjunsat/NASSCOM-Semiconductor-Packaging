üìò Overview

This module covers the die attach process, curing techniques, and the difference between wirebond and flip-chip packaging. It focuses on how a processed silicon wafer is converted into individual packaged dies mounted on substrates for electrical, thermal, and mechanical reliability.

üß± 1. Wafer Preparation and Backside Processing

All electronic circuits are fabricated on the front side of the silicon wafer.
The back side acts purely as a mechanical support layer and does not contain any active devices.

Before packaging, unnecessary material is removed from the wafer back side to make it thinner and lighter.

The front side is laminated for protection.

The back side is mechanically ground to achieve the required thickness.

This process minimizes the inactive silicon area and helps reduce overall package height.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Die Selection and Substrate Mounting

After wafer dicing, only the known good dies (KGD) are selected for packaging.
Each die is then attached to a substrate, which can be either a leadframe or a laminate substrate.

üî© Die Attach Stage

The die attach process uses an adhesive material called die attach film (DAF) or epoxy to fix the die onto the substrate.

Steps:

Apply a thin layer of epoxy or adhesive film on the substrate.

The pattern of epoxy application varies depending on the package type and performance requirements.

Place the silicon die precisely on top of the epoxy layer.

Different epoxy application patterns directly influence thermal performance, adhesion strength, and processing speed.

üî• 3. Curing Process

Curing is the step that hardens and solidifies polymer-based materials such as epoxy, underfill, or molding compound used in the package.

Purpose

Curing provides mechanical strength and thermal stability by solidifying the adhesive or protective material that holds the die to the substrate.

Key Functions

Supports the chip and substrate mechanically.

Prevents stress and cracking during temperature changes.

Ensures proper adhesion between materials with different thermal expansion rates.

How It Works

The epoxy or molding compound is applied in liquid or paste form.

It is heated (in an oven or via UV light) to trigger polymerization.

The material transforms into a solid with high adhesion and insulation strength.

Importance

Prevents chip cracking or delamination.

Increases solder joint reliability.

Maintains overall package integrity, especially in high-density interconnect packages such as BGA, FCBGA, and 3D ICs.

In short:
Curing is the controlled hardening of protective materials to ensure the package remains mechanically and thermally stable throughout its life cycle.

ü™° 4. Wirebond vs. Flip-Chip Packaging

Wirebond packaging is simpler and more cost-effective compared to flip-chip assembly.
It remains the preferred method for low-to-medium I/O applications due to its proven reliability and low cost.

Wirebond Advantages

Easier and cheaper to implement.

Flexible for small and medium pin-count devices.

Mature technology with high yield.

Flip-Chip Advantages

Suitable for high-performance and high-I/O chips.

Shorter electrical paths result in lower inductance and better signal speed.

Limitation

For devices with extremely fine interconnects, reliability challenges arise due to mechanical stress and solder fatigue. Therefore, flip-chip packaging is only adopted when performance requirements justify the complexity and cost.

üß† Summary

Circuits exist only on the wafer‚Äôs front side; the back side is structural.

The die attach process uses epoxy or DAF to fix the chip to its substrate.

Curing hardens the polymer materials, improving mechanical strength and reliability.

Wirebond packaging remains the standard for cost-sensitive designs, while flip-chip is reserved for high-density, performance-critical systems.



Note ---- all the circuits and everything is on yhe front side of the wafer, backside is just the substrate which is supporting mechanically to the circuits which are fabricated.
We want to get rid of the places where no circuits are present and make it as minimum width as possible
So the front side is laminated and the backside is grinded
