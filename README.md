Duration: 10 Days
Platform: Windows (VSD-IAT LMS)
Tools Used: ANSYS Electronics Desktop, ANSYS Mechanical
📘 Repository Overview

This repository documents my work, lab outputs, and learnings from the Packaging Fundamentals of Design and Testing Workshop.
It includes notes, simulations, models, and project files created during the 10-day program, focusing on the complete semiconductor packaging flow — from wafer to package design, reliability testing, and thermal analysis.

🧱 Module-Wise Summary
Module 1 — Packaging Evolution: From Basics to 3D Integration

Understood the evolution of semiconductor packaging from traditional leadframe to 2.5D and 3D integration.

Studied various package types (DIP, QFN, PBGA, FC-CSP, CoWoS).

Explored interposer technologies, redistribution layers (RDL), and chiplet-based architectures.

Performed comparative analysis of performance, cost, and complexity.

Module 2 — From Wafer to Package: Assembly and Manufacturing Essentials

Learned wafer preparation steps — grinding, dicing, and die selection.

Simulated die attach and wire-bonding processes.

Understood molding, sealing, and marking stages of package assembly.

Created process-flow diagrams from wafer exit to final packaging.

Module 3 — Thermal Simulation of Semiconductor Packages (ANSYS)

Modeled a Flip-Chip BGA package in ANSYS Electronics Desktop (AEDT).

Defined material properties, power sources, and boundary conditions.

Generated finite-element mesh and ran steady-state thermal analysis.

Analyzed junction-to-ambient and junction-to-case temperature profiles.

Compared thermal performance across different package types.

Module 4 — Package Reliability: Testing and Validation

Studied electrical and functional testing procedures (open/short tests, continuity).

Analyzed reliability methods:

Temperature Cycling (TC)

High Temperature Operating Life (HTOL)

Highly Accelerated Stress Test (HAST)

Thermal Shock and Vibration Testing

Documented performance validation metrics and failure analysis techniques.

Module 5 — Package Design & Modeling

Built a complete package cross-section model in ANSYS AEDT.

Created die and substrate layers, defined bond pads, and modeled wire bonds.

Added die-attach layer, mold compound, and finalized the 3D package design.

Conducted thermo-mechanical stress analysis using ANSYS Mechanical.
